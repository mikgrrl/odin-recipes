    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      <em>
        Many people consider this type of strawberry ice cream recipe a 'hack'
        or a 'cheat' because we're skipping the more time-consuming and
        sometimes temperamental egg-custard step; but even if I didn't want to
        save time I'd still prefer this method. To be clear, I'm only speaking
        about this specific flavor of ice cream. For deep, dark chocolate, or
        butter pecan, I'll take the classic French-style every time. But, for
        sweet, juicy strawberries, I'm not a big fan of the egginess you get
        with the traditional method.
